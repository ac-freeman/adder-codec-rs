//! Helper trait for creating Models which only accept a single symbol

/// A [`Model`] is used to calculate the probability of a given symbol occuring
/// in a sequence.
///
/// The [`Model`] is used both for encoding and decoding. A
/// 'fixed-length' model always expects an exact number of symbols, and so does
/// not need to encode an EOF symbol.
///
/// A fixed length model can be converted into a regular model using the
/// convenience [`Wrapper`] type.
///
/// The more accurately a [`Model`] is able to predict the next symbol, the
/// greater the compression ratio will be.
